# Preparation: Defining Re-Usable Assumption Checks
To standardize assumption checks throughout the assignment, we use the following function. It plots the histogram, qq-plot, and boxplots for all variables of interest and returns the shapiro-wilk test.

```{r, code = readLines("../utilities.R")}
```

```{r child = 'w1ex1.Rmd'}
```

```{r child = 'w1ex2.Rmd'}
```

```{r child = 'w1ex3.Rmd'}
```

```{r child = 'w1ex4.Rmd'}
```
